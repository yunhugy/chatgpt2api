> [!NOTE]
> This repository is a fork of [yukkcat/chatgpt2api](https://github.com/yukkcat/chatgpt2api) that adds **automated account registration** and **proxy scheduling** for self-hosted deployments.
>
> Key differences from upstream:
>
> - **Registrar**: built-in account auto-registration in the console, with total / quota / available top-up modes, concurrency control, and a consecutive-failure circuit breaker.
> - **Registration proxy pool**: registration tasks rotate egress from a subscription source and schedule by measured quality — proven exits are reused first, one failure demotes, two failures blacklist the whole IP.
> - **Proxy and clearance**: a settings panel for runtime proxy and Cloudflare clearance (FlareSolverr / manual cookie), with connectivity tests and runtime status.
> - **Fingerprint alignment**: the registrar pins the browser fingerprint with the highest measured pass rate, and proxy filtering uses the same fingerprint.
>
> Container image: `ghcr.io/yunhugy/chatgpt2api:latest` (upstream: `ghcr.io/yukkcat/chatgpt2api`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `v3.0.0` is a new release baseline. The remote `main` history has been consolidated, and older source history, Git tags, releases, and container images are no longer maintained as part of the current release line. Version 3.0 uses a new Application Database and cannot read the distributed storage used by 2.x directly. Reconfigure the service or re-import accounts after upgrading.

> [!WARNING]
> This project accesses ChatGPT Web text, image, and file-generation capabilities through reverse engineering and is not an official OpenAI service. Upstream changes may break these interfaces or cause account restrictions and temporary or permanent bans; do not use important, frequently used, or high-value accounts.
>
> Users must understand the technical, account, and compliance risks and comply with OpenAI's terms and applicable laws. Bulk abuse, malicious competition, account theft, fraud, harassment, and the generation or distribution of illegal, violent, sexual, or minor-related content are strictly prohibited. Users assume all risks and consequences.

## Quick Start

### One-click installer

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yunhugy/chatgpt2api/main/deploy/install.sh | sudo bash
```

The installer lets you choose SQLite, a local PostgreSQL 18 container, or an existing PostgreSQL URL. SQLite requires no additional service. Local PostgreSQL is started and persisted automatically through Compose.

To install the fixed `v3.2.3` release:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yunhugy/chatgpt2api/v3.2.3.6/deploy/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- --branch v3.2.3.6
```

### Docker Compose

SQLite is used by default:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yunhugy/chatgpt2api.git
cd chatgpt2api
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set a private CHATGPT2API_AUTH_KEY
test -f config.json || printf '{}\n' > config.json
docker compose up -d
```

| Endpoint | Address |
| :--- | :--- |
| Admin console | `http://localhost:3000` |
| OpenAI-compatible API | `http://localhost:3000/v1` |
| Data directory | `./data` |

`CHATGPT2API_AUTH_KEY` in `.env` takes precedence over `auth-key` in `config.json`. Compose uses a dedicated runtime volume for console-managed online updates. Console settings, upstream accounts, user keys, call records, and metrics are stored in the Application Database. Do not commit local `.env`, `config.json`, or `data/` files.

### PostgreSQL 18

Set `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in `.env`, then layer the PostgreSQL Compose file over the base stack:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.postgres.yml up -d
```

This configuration uses `postgres:18-alpine`, persists data in a named volume, and does not expose the database port by default. To use an existing PostgreSQL server, set:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database
```

See the [deployment guide](./docs/deployment.md) for upgrades, backups, PostgreSQL setup, and troubleshooting.

## Project Scope

ChatGPT2API is continuously developed from [basketikun/chatgpt2api](https://github.com/basketikun/chatgpt2api). It uses the ChatGPT Web protocol to expose the OpenAI-compatible interfaces implemented by this project.

## Capabilities

Shared UI components, themes, and interaction primitives come from [yukkcat/nanocat-ui](https://github.com/yukkcat/nanocat-ui). This repository owns the product pages, backend state projections, and domain workflows.

```

The Application Database stores accounts, user keys, settings, call records, and metrics. Images and generated files remain in dedicated file storage. See the [storage architecture](./docs/storage-architecture.md) for ownership boundaries.

## API

All AI endpoints use a Bearer key:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <auth-key>
```

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/v1/models` | `GET` | Returns the shared console model catalog; default chat models are `gpt-5.6` and `auto` |
| `/v1/chat/completions` | `POST` | Chat Completions entry point for text, search, and image scenarios |
| `/v1/responses` | `POST` | Responses entry point with text, search, and image tools |
| `/v1/messages` | `POST` | Anthropic Messages-compatible entry point |
| `/v1/search` | `POST` | Returns an answer, citations, and search results |
| `/v1/images/generations` | `POST` | Image generation with `n=1..4` |
| `/v1/images/edits` | `POST` | Image editing from multipart files, remote URLs, base64, data URLs, or multiple references |
| `/v1/editable-file-tasks` | `GET / POST` | Creates and queries editable PPT/PSD tasks |
| `/v1/editable-file-tasks/{task_id}` | `DELETE` | Deletes a task owned by the current key |
| `/v1/ppt/generations` | `POST` | PPT task shortcut |
| `/v1/psd/generations` | `POST` | PSD task shortcut |
| `/files/{file_path}` | `GET` | Publicly downloads a generated file from its random storage path |

Creating, querying, and deleting file tasks is isolated by API key. The `/files/...` links returned by successful tasks work like generated-image links: anyone holding the link can download the asset without authentication. Public downloads validate paths and file types and reject path traversal.

<details>
<summary>Chat Completions example</summary>

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <auth-key>" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-5","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Introduce this project"}],"stream":true}'
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Image generation example</summary>

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/images/generations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <auth-key>" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-image-2","prompt":"A cat floating in space, cinematic lighting","n":1,"response_format":"b64_json"}'
```

</details>

Available models depend on the upstream accounts and the current `/v1/models` response.

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `CHATGPT2API_AUTH_KEY` | Required | Administrator and default API key; the environment variable takes precedence over `config.json` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | SQLite | Application Database connection; defaults to `data/chatgpt2api.db` when unset |
| `CHATGPT2API_BASE_URL` | Current service URL | Public base URL used for generated image and file links |
| `CHATGPT2API_THREAD_TOKENS` | `120` | Capacity for synchronous backend worker threads; accepts any positive integer, while accounts, proxies, and upstream services retain their own limits |
| `account_processing_concurrency` | `30` | Capacity for account imports, refreshes, synchronization, and batch processing |
| `image_account_concurrency` | `1` | Per-account image concurrency, configurable from 1 to 3 |
| `image_stream_timeout_secs` | `80` | Maximum wait for the upstream image SSE/HTTP stream |
| `image_poll_timeout_secs` | `60` | Maximum wait for image result polling and parsing |
| `log_retention_hours` | `24` | Automatic call-record retention period in hours |

Other settings are managed through the console. The current backend projection is authoritative for defaults and constraints.

## Local Development

```bash
# Backend: Python 3.13 + uv
uv sync
uv run main.py

# Frontend: Node.js + npm
cd web-vue
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend development server defaults to `http://localhost:5173`, with backend requests forwarded by the Vite development proxy.
